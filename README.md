# Intro

My first try on VueJS, a simple currency calculator using fixed values.
I made it the as simple as possible, so almost all javascript is in one file, so it can be oppened very easily locally in any machine.

## How to Execute

You can execute it in a few ways:

1) just access: https://maiolo.github.io/currency_calc/index.html

2) clone the repository to your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/maiolo/currency_calc.git
```
and open the *"index.html"* file

3) Just download as a zip and open the *"index.html"* file
